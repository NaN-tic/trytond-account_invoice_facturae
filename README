This Module runs with the Tryton application platform.

This module is developed and tested over a Tryton server and core modules
patched with patches from `trytond-patches project`_ (take care with the
branches). Maybe these patches are required for the module to work.

.. _trytond-patches project: https://bitbucket.org/nantic/trytond-patches

The FacturaevX_X_X-offline.xml is the same that FacturaevX_X_X.xml but gets the
xmldsig-core-schema.xsd file from local because it fails to download from
w3.org website.

The file are obtained from:
https://www.facturae.gob.es/formato/Paginas/formato.aspx
